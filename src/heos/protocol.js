// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HEOS CLI protocol — pure functions only.
//
// HEOS is Denon/Marantz's separate network-audio control plane (also used by
// their standalone HEOS speakers): a plain-text, line-based TCP service on
// port 1255, entirely independent from the legacy "AVR Control" Telnet
// service on port 23 (src/denon/protocol.js). On a HEOS-equipped AVR, a
// network/streaming source that goes through HEOS (Qobuz, TIDAL, Spotify
// Connect, TuneIn...) is actually driven by HEOS under the hood — the legacy
// NS9x transport commands only ever reach the older, non-HEOS Net/USB
// subsystem, which is why they were confirmed (real hardware, this
// integration's own changelog) to have no effect on HEOS-managed playback.
//
// Commands are `heos://` URIs terminated by "\r\n" (see src/heos/client.js);
// responses are JSON, one object per line, shaped:
//   { "heos": { "command": "...", "result": "success"|"fail", "message": "k=v&k=v" }, "payload": [...] }
// `message` is itself a URL-query-string of extra key/value pairs — never a
// bare string — including on event pushes.
//
// No official Denon-published spec exists the way the AVR Control PDF does;
// this is cross-checked against `pyheos` (github.com/andrewsayre/pyheos),
// the library behind Home Assistant's own official HEOS integration, plus
// the field names in the (unofficial, widely mirrored) HEOS CLI Protocol
// Specification. Confidence is "should work, matches a library used in
// production by Home Assistant" — NOT verified against this project's own
// real hardware (the S970H this integration is developed against has never
// had its HEOS features exercised by this codebase before). If it
// misbehaves on a real receiver, `node scripts/debug-heos.js <host>` is the
// tool to compare actual JSON traffic against what's expected here.
